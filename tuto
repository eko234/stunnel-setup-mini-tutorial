1) install stunnel (e.g: sudo apt-get install stunnel)

2) go to /etc/stunnel/ and: 
  -create a stunnel.conf file: 
      | cert = /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem
      | sslVersion = TLSv1.2 
      | pid = /stunnel.pid
      | [name-of-service]
      | accept = 127.0.0.1:1965 [port to listen]
      | connect = 127.0.0.1:1964 [port to redirect]
  -add a pem key using the following commands:
    -openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out stunnel.pem -keyout stunnel.pem
    -openssl genrsh 2048 >> stunnel.pem
    -finally, move to the dir where you parametrized stunnel to find it

3) run stunnel with sudo stunnel and remember that if you already ran that command
   you should kill the process in order for it to load the new params you set up

4) you are good to go, this mini tutorial was made with the haskell gemini-server in mind
   and works quite well, hope it helps.
